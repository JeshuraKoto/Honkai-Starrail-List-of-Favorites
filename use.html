        <h2>Kafka</h2>
        <p>Kafka fits best in teams built around DoT effects. She works well with characters who apply Shock, Burn, or Bleed, maximizing her damage output.</p>

        <h2>Blade</h2>
        <p>Blade is a strong pick for teams that provide healing and sustain. He pairs well with supports who can keep him alive while he continuously sacrifices HP for high damage.</p>
